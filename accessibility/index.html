                <p class="history"><strong>William Shakespeare</strong>                    (baptised 26 April 1564; died 23 April 1616) was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.He is often called England's national poet and the
                    &quot;Bard of Avon&quot;.His surviving works, including some collaborations, consist of 38 plays,54 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are
                    performed more often than those of any other playwright.</p>
            <br class="clearfloat">
                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, a successful glover and alderman originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised on 26 April
                    1564. His actual birthdate is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, St George's Day.This date, which can be traced back to an eighteenth-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing because Shakespeare died on 23 April
                    1616.He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.</p>
                <p>Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare may have been educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553,about a quarter of a mile from his home. Grammar
                    schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but the curriculum was dictated by law throughout England,and the school would have provided an intensive education in Latin grammar and the classics.</p>

                <blockquote>To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br /> Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br /> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br /> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br /> And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br
                    /> No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br /> The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br /> That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br /> Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br /> To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's
                    the rub;<br /> For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br /> When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br /> Must give us pause: there's the respect<br /> That makes calamity of so long life;<br /> For who would bear the
                    whips and scorns of time,<br /> The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br /> The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br /> The insolence of office and the spurns<br /> That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />                    When he himself might his quietus make<br /> With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br /> To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br /> But that the dread of something after death,<br /> The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br
                    /> No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br /> And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br /> Than fly to others that we know not of?<br /> Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br /> And thus the native hue of resolution<br
                    /> Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br /> And enterprises of great pith and moment<br /> With this regard their currents turn awry,<br /> And lose the name of action.—Soft you now!<br /> The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy
                    orisons<br /> Be all my sins remember'd.</blockquote>
